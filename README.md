# The JavaFX Documentation Project
The JavaFX Documentation Project is designed to collect important JavaFX information from around the web and, with the permission of the authors, to collate it into a single source to form a cohesive book.

The documentation is written in AsciiDoc. On every commit to this GitHub repo a build process is run, resulting in newly-built content available in <a href="https://fxdocs.github.io/docs/index.html">HTML</a> and as a <a href="https://fxdocs.github.io/docs/book.pdf">single PDF file</a>.

The JavaFX Documentation Project uses Travis CI to perform continuous builds of the AsciiDoc source. The current status of the build is:
