= Introduction

The JavaFX Documentation Project aims to pull together useful information for JavaFX developers from all over the web. The project is http://www.github.com/FXDocs/docs[open source] and encourages community participation to ensure that the documentation is as highly polished and useful as possible.

== Contributors

This project would not be possible without the contributors who work hard on the content contained within this documentation. Whenever possible contributors are given attribution within the document when they write a section, but it is also important to gather all names here, at the top of the document, to give the recognition that these contributors deserve.

== Contributing

Contributing to this project is easy - fork the http://www.github.com/FXDocs/docs[GitHub] repo, edit the relevant files, and create a pull request! Once merged, your content will form a part of the documentation and you'll have the unending appreciation of the entire community!

The JavaFX Documentation Project uses AsciiDoc as the syntax of choice for writing the documentation. The http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc Syntax Quick Reference] guide is a great resource for those learning how to write AsciiDoc.
